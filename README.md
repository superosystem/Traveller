# Traveller Automated KTP Validation Using OCR Technology

## Introduction
In contemporary mobile applications, users often encounter the inconvenience of manually inputting their personal information. This challenge was evident in the case presented for the company-based capstone project, specifically in the OCR for KTP Validation. Despite the technological advancements, the app still necessitated users to manually input their data from their KTP. Recognizing the inconvenience and error-prone nature of manual data entry, our project aimed to enhance user experience by implementing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. By creating an application that enables users to capture their KTP and automatically retrieve the information, we sought to save users' time and effort, thus significantly improving user satisfaction and efficiency.

## Project Objectives
1. **Eliminate Manual Data Entry:** Develop a solution that eliminates the need for users to manually input their personal information from their KTP into the mobile application.
2. **Enhance User Experience:** Improve user experience by offering a seamless and efficient way for users to input their data, thereby reducing frustration and saving time.
3. **Minimize Errors:** Reduce the occurrence of errors caused by manual data entry, ensuring accurate information capture for records.

## Technological Approach
Our project utilized Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, a cutting-edge technique that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. By integrating OCR algorithms into the app, we enabled the application to recognize text and characters from images of KTP.

## Features and Functionalities
1. **Image Capture:** Users can capture an image of their KTP using the mobile application.
2. **OCR Processing:** The captured image undergoes OCR processing to extract text and characters from the KTP.
3. **Data Retrieval:** Extracted data, including name, address, date of birth, and other relevant details, is retrieved and populated within the mobile application.
4. **User Verification:** Users are prompted to verify the extracted information for accuracy before confirming the submission.

## Benefits
1. **Time-Saving:** Users can complete the registration process swiftly without spending time manually inputting their information.
2. **Accuracy:** By eliminating manual entry, the accuracy of user data is significantly improved, reducing the chances of errors.
3. **User Satisfaction:** Enhanced user experience leads to higher satisfaction levels, increasing user loyalty towards the mobile application.

## Conclusion
By implementing OCR technology in the mobile application, our project successfully addressed the inconvenience associated with manual data entry. Through this initiative, the application can offer a more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly platform, thereby ensuring a positive user experience. This project not only aligns with the commitment to technological innovation but also demonstrates dedication to enhancing customer satisfaction in the digital age.
